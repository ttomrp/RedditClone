This is a guided project that can be found here: https://programmingtechie.com/2020/05/14/building-a-reddit-clone-with-spring-boot-and-angular/

Note: This implementation of the guided project differs slightly from the original specs.

1. PostgreSQL is used instead of MySQL.
2. SecurityConfig is changed due to WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter being depricated.
